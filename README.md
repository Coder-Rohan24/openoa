You are designing a professional full-stack SaaS application called "OpenOA Cloud Analyst".

It is a wind energy analytics platform powered by the OpenOA Python library.

Generate a clean, production-ready folder structure for a 2-day MVP that includes:

Backend:
- FastAPI
- Service layer
- Local OpenOA copy
- Temporary file storage

Frontend:
- React + Vite
- TailwindCSS
- Pages and reusable components
- Chart.js integration

The architecture should:
- Be minimal but scalable
- Avoid overengineering
- Avoid microservices
- Avoid unnecessary layers
- Be clean and professional

Output the folder structure tree only.
